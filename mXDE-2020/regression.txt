Regression tests are run using the WUSTL_RESTful_CLI code.
* You will always be in the root folder.
* You will run regression tests like this:
  ./restful_tests/regression/scripts/xxxxx.sh

QEDm / Conditions
  edit restful_tests/qedm/server/QEDM-1110J/test_plan.txt
  Change the value for the FHIR patient id in the query line (patient=xxx)

  ./restful_tests/regression/scripts/qedm_condition.sh
  open /tmp/qedm/server/condition/summary.txt
  open /tmp/qedm/server/condition/QEDM-1110J.xlsx
    The summary and spreadsheet should indicate no errors
    If you see errors, then open for more details
       /tmp/qedm/server/condition/QEDM-1110J.txt
